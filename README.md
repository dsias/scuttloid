Scuttloid
=========

Scuttloid is a [Semantic Scuttle](https://github.com/cweiske/SemanticScuttle) Android app. It is also compatible with [Memor](https://github.com/ilesinge/memor), as it partially implements the Semantic Scuttle API.

Latest stable version available on [F-Droid](http://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=gr.ndre.scuttloid).

**Features:**

- Lists your bookmarks from a Semantic Scuttle server
- Show detailed view of a bookmark
- Add a bookmark
- Share a URL to Scuttloid to add a bookmark
- Edit your bookmarks
- Delete a bookmark
- Open or share a bookmark

Scuttloid may work with Scuttle.

**Known Issues:**

- The privacy status is not retained when editing an existing bookmark. This is due to a limitation in Semantic Scuttle API.
- The pricacy status is not meaningfull in the case of a Memor server (as Memor does not include such a concept).

Please use GitHub issue tracker if you encounter any issue.
